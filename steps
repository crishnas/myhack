STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
🔹 Step 1: Prepare Data in Alteryx
Open Alteryx Designer

Input data from Excel/CSV/Database/API.

Use tools to:

Join datasets

Clean/transform data

Aggregate or enrich fields (e.g., segmentation, scoring)

Output Options:

Use “Output Data” tool:

Format: .hyper, .tde, or .csv

Destination: Local file or publish to Tableau Server

Or use “Publish to Tableau Server” tool for direct push.

🔄 Set Alteryx workflow to automate refresh if needed.

🔹 Step 2: Connect to Snowflake in Tableau
Open Tableau Desktop.

Select “Snowflake” from the list of connectors.

Provide credentials:

Server: xyz.snowflakecomputing.com

Warehouse, database, schema, and role

Choose live or extract mode.

Drag tables or views into the canvas.

🔹 Step 3: Bring in Alteryx Output
In Tableau Desktop, go to:

Data → New Data Source → Hyper File
(or connect to Tableau Server if published from Alteryx)

Choose your .hyper or .tde file from disk.

Confirm schema and data preview.

🔹 Step 4: Combine Both Data Sources
Option A: Relationships (Recommended)
In Data Model (logical layer), drag both sources in and create relationship using a common key (customer_id, region, etc.)

Tableau joins them only when needed → better performance.

Option B: Data Blending (Older method)
Use one source as primary (blue checkmark), others as secondary.

Link by common dimension in the worksheet (e.g., customer_id).

🔹 Step 5: Create Dashboard
Create visualizations (charts, KPIs, tables) from both data sources.

Drag sheets into a Dashboard view.

Add filters, interactivity, parameters, etc.

Validate filters work across sources if blending/relationships are used.

🔹 Step 6: Publish to Tableau Server (Optional)
File → Publish to Tableau Server

Include:

Extract refresh settings

Credentials for Snowflake (prompted or embedded)

Create refresh schedule for .hyper files (if using Tableau Server)
