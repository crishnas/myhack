Summary: Grady Report Concerns & Next Steps
🔍 Context:
Mike generated a summary-level report from the Grady database, intended to provide quick visibility into open operational cases (enrollment/redemption).

The report helped reduce anxiety by surfacing volume but raised major data quality and completeness concerns:

~13,000 outstanding cases reported.

No fulfillment cases were included.

Some cases >60 days old, which seems inaccurate.

No drill-down capability or detailed case context.

Data pulled solely from Grady — known to be unreliable.

❗ Key Concerns Raised:
Data Validity:

Is 13,000 a valid count of “outstanding” cases?

Aging logic is questionable. Back office processes shouldn’t allow 60+ day old cases.

Missing Case Types:

Report does not include fulfillment cases — an essential component.

Inaccurate Source Data:

Grady is not a trusted system of record.

Moving Grady data to Snowflake or Alteryx won’t solve data quality issues — just relocates the problem.

Limited Scope of Mike’s Report:

Original intent was only to provide oversight of operations team workloads post-partner interactions — not full end-to-end visibility.

Larger picture (from Realms download to Ops resolution) was never in scope for that report.

🧭 Clarifications Provided:
Team Goal:
Build end-to-end dashboards across 3 vantage points:

Realms data (batch process tracking)

API-based enrollment verification

Grady/Operations case handling

Mike’s Report:
Served as a temporary visibility tool — not the foundation for long-term reporting.
Acknowledged as limited, but helped flag open questions.

Long-Term Problem Acknowledged:
The real solution is replacing legacy systems (Grady + backend) — underway via a separate stream led by Ashley & Don.

✅ Consensus:
Using Grady data as-is won’t produce a reliable work-in-progress (WIP) report.

Building dashboards in Snowflake on bad source data is not a fix.

Access to Grady via FIDS won’t help unless the underlying data quality improves.

🔄 Recommended Next Steps:
Clarify Report Requirements (ASAP):

Define exact metrics and fields needed for end-to-end WIP reporting.

Separate expectations: what is feasible today vs. what needs system transformation.

Data Profiling & Validation Exercise:

Perform a joint analysis of Grady data (sample extract) to validate Don’s and Mike’s assumptions.

Identify data gaps and fields needed for fulfillment/aging logic.

Alteryx Prototype (Short-Term):

Use Alteryx (or similar tooling) to build interim visualizations.

Clearly mark limitations due to known data gaps in Grady.

Long-Term Ownership:

Align with Ashley & Don on the target state systems roadmap.

Ensure reporting use cases are fed into those plans.
